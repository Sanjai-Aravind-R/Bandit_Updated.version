_Bandit is an introductory wargame by OverTheWire that focuses on building a strong foundation in Linux and security concepts. Level 0 is designed for absolute beginners and introduces the most important skill required for the entire game: logging into a remote system using SSH.

The Bandit Level 0 page clearly outlines the goal of the challenge. The task is not to exploit anything, but simply to establish a secure connection to the Bandit server. All required credentials are openly provided, making this level a guided learning step rather than a test of problem-solving.

The challenge page specifies the remote host, a non-default SSH port, and login credentials. This teaches an important lesson early on: real-world systems may not always use default configurations, and paying attention to connection details is crucial.

Before diving into advanced topics like privilege escalation or file manipulation, it is essential to understand how to access a system properly. Level 0 ensures that the player is comfortable with reading instructions and recognizing essential connection parameters._
